<p>
The learning outcomes of this assignment are:
<ol>
<li>Ability to design and implement classes in C++, using the <b>g++</b>
    compiler. Here is Juan Soulie's <a href="../Assign5/tutorial.jar">tutorial.jar</a>
    which covers the basics of C++.
</li>
<li>Knowledge working with the <b>Ant</b> build tool and the command-line
    and a text editor for developing <b>C++</b> applications.
</li>
<li>Experience working with <b>C++ Full Light ToolKit (FLTK)</b> user-interfaces and
    their components; especially simple controls that
    do not require an underlying data model or data source.
    Handling events generated by <b>FLTK</b> components.
</li>
<li>Experience creating C++ programs having multiple classes</li>
<li>Experience using pre-compiled auxilary C++ classes contained in <b>library</b> archive.</li>
<li>Experience working with <b>Serialization</b> using <b>Json</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The pre-requisites for this assignment are:
<ol>
  <li>Units 1-4 of the Ser321 course content. This includes Linux, C++, Ant, UI FLTK, and
  Json Serialization</li>
  <li>The Development Environment for this assignment includes VirtualBox Linux with
  the packages <b>ant, g++,</b> and <b>libjsoncpp package</b>. Note that <b>Ant</b> must
  be augmented with the <b>cpptasks.jar</b> as explained in the <b>readme.txt</b>
  file of the <b>C++</b> example:
  <a href="http://pooh.poly.asu.edu/Ser321/Examples/ObjC/cppFraction.jar">cppFraction.jar</a>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In this assignment, create a non-distributed
<b>Music Browser</b> application in C++ that utilizes the instructor
provided <b>FLTK GUI</b>. The <b>Music Browser</b> is
a collection of <b>Album</b> objects, similar to that created in the two prior <b>Java</b>
assignments. You are to create <b>Album</b>, and <b>Track</b> classes,
that serializes/deserializes to/from the same text file you produced in the preceding
assignment, which is in <b>Json</b> format.
Note that you should initiate your application with the same <b>json file</b> as used for
the <b>Java</b> version of this assignment.
The user interface provides the ability
for browsing albums that are in the collection.
<p>The browser's constructor should read in the file initializing the
(<b>Music Library</b>) to include a collection of albums. Your Album and Track classes should
include a constructors to initialize an object from a <b>Json::Value</b>, and
another method to export an object to a <b>Json::Value</b>. Be
sure to include an appropriate initialization file with the solution you submit.
<p>
The user interface for your client is provided in the example
<a href="./assign4WebDist.jar">assign4WebDist.jar</a>. It includes a <b>readme.txt</b> file
explaining how to run the sample. The included <b>Ant</b> build
file will compile and execute a sample client. It depends on three libraries that you should
install on your development environment (see the class resources pages and the readme.txt file
in the sample). The sample includes <b>src/sample/MediaClientGui.cpp</b> 
provides the instructor provided <b>MediaClientGui</b> class, which is the <b>View</b> for your
solution.
There is also a sample main program demonstrating the use of the GUI with <b>C++</b> in the
program <b>src/sample/samplemain.cpp</b>. This is an example <b>Controller</b> for the <b>View</b>.
<p>
Another example project that demonstrates serialziation to/from <b>Json</b> for both <b>C++</b> and
<b>Java</b> is provided in the example
<a href="http://pooh.poly.asu.edu/Ser321/Examples/Serial/groupJson.jar">groupJson.jar</a>.
<p>
Below is a view of the <b>MediaClientGui</b>.
You should use this <b>FLTK</b> GUI for solving this assignment.

<p>
In summary, create a stand-alone Music Browser Client application, using <b>C++/FLTK</b>.
Your application should
initialize a music library from a <b>Json</b> file, and have the ability to select, remove,
and add albums and tracks within albums. You should also support exporting the library of Albums
using <b>Json</b> serialization to a file. Future
assignments will enhance this solution by distributing it using <b>JsonRPC</b>.
<p>
<b>Functionality</b>. Your solution should provide the same functionality as the stand-alone
<b>Java Music Browser</b> application you completed in prior assignments
<p>
Your <b>C++</b> files should contain class comments similar in structure to that of the instructor's example
code. This constraint applies to all source code you submit in this course. The comments should include a 
right-to-use license that provides the course the right to compile, run, and evaluate the software for
purposes of course grading and program (BSSE) assessment. The comments should also include your copyright,
your name, purpose, and your contact information (email), as well as software version and
modification/creation date.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Music Library Interface</FONT></B>
<p>
To make future assignments easier, your solution should include three classes for the underlying application
<b>Model</b>: <b>Album</b>, <b>Track</b>, and <b>MusicLibrary</b>.
These classes should have constructors for <b>Json::Value</b>, and a method
to export and object's state to <b>Json::Value</b>. Your <b>MusicLibrary</b> class may also
support methods similar to those defined in the <b>Java</b> version of this assignment. The next
assignment will create a <b>JsonRpc</b> server for your <b>MusicLibrary</b>.
<p>
The following examples should provide the basis for constructing your
solution.
<ul>
  <li><b><a href="http://pooh.poly.asu.edu/Ser321/Examples/Serial/groupJson.jar">groupJson.jar</a></b>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  This example project demonstrates <b>Json</b> serialization and deserialization in Java and C++.
  </li>
  <li><b><a href="http://pooh.poly.asu.edu/Ser321/Examples/FltkGUI/guiDemo.jar">guiDemo.jar</a></b>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  This project demonstrates use of <b>Model</b>, <b>View</b>, and <b>Control (MVC)</b> separation
  of concerns for <b>Windowed</b> applicaitons in Java with <b>Swing</b> and C++ with <b>FLTK</b>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Here are links to api documentation for the relevant frameworks <b>json-java</b>,<b>json-cpp</b>,
<b>jsonrpc-cpp</b>, and <b>FLTK</b>.

<p>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Structure of your Solution Directory</FONT></B>
<p>
Submit your solution on Canvas as a Java archive file (jar) of the project directory:
<b>Assign4</b>.
Grading your project will be done by extracting the jar and executing
the project using Ant from the command-line on Virtual Box Debian as defined as the
<b>Course Development Environment</b>.
The project directory should include only the following files,
subdirectories and classes:
<ul>
  <li>The Ant directive file <b>build.xml</b>.
  The build should contain targets for
  <b>targets, clean, prepare, build,</b> and <b>execute</b>. The
  <b>execute</b>
  target compiles and executes your <b>C++</b> Music Browser with appropriate arguments.
  Other examples are covered in class to provide <b>Json</b> serialization.</li>
  <li>Subdirectory: <b>src/client</b> for your solution's source files.</li>
  <li>Subdirectory <b>bin</b> used to store the executable program as generated by your <b>build</b>
      target. The <b>bin</b> folder may be generated by Ant.</li>
  <li>A file <b>albums.json</b> which contains a <b>Json</b> initialization file for your music
      library. </li>
</ul>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>What To Hand-In</FONT></B>
<p>
Hand-in this program by submitting a jar file to the Canvas page for this assignment.
<p>
When extracted, your solution jar file should create the directory
<b>Assign4</b>
with only your solution files as specified above. Create your jar file from
a command line whose current working directory is <b>Assign4</b>'s
parent directory. Execute the command:
<br><center><font color=#9B0033>
jar -cvf assign4myasuriteid.jar Assign4/
</font></center><br>
The instructors solution would be created and named as:
<br><center><font color=#9B0033>
jar -cvf assign4lindquis.jar Assign4/
</font></center><br>
Before you submit the jar file on Canvas, please do the following:
<ul>
  <li>Check to assure your solution conforms to the directions on this page.
  <li>Consider the grading criteria as shown below to be sure that you'll
  receive full credit for your submission.
  Of 20 possible points, they are awarded for:
  <ol> 
      <li>Properly formated and named solution file. The Assign4 directory
      should have the files specified above (only) (5 points).</li>
      <li><b>Functionality</b>. The <b>C++</b> application is able to support
      all of the functionality defined in prior assignments:
      Initializing the library from the <b>Json</b> file and the functioning
      <b>Gui</b> for searching and browsing its contents. (10 points)
      <li><b>C++ classes and usage</b>. The solution should use the convention of <b>.hpp</b>
      to hold the <b>C++</b> class header, and <b>.cpp</b> to hold the <b>C++</b> class
      implementation. The application is segmented into
      appropriately named classes for <b>Album, Track, MusicLibrary, and MusicBrowser,</b>
      and instructor provided <b>GUI</b>. These classes are commented as described
      in class and above, and as exemplified through instructor code
      (5 points).</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Clean your solution directory of any temporary files
      before creating the jar file. Extract the solution
      in another directory, build and execute the solution to be certain
      it works properly.
</ul>
